# Oh? What is this?

'Tis a vendor tree for replacing the apps preinstalled on /e/OS with
Simple Apps (Simple Dialer, Simple Calendar, etc) and some others
[AITEx64](https://github.com/AITEx64) prefers. Maintained by [Beru
Shinsetsu](https://github.com/windowz414).

# But why?

Well, not everyone prefers to have Lineage/AOSP stuff on the ROM
they use - And several ROMs like to ship their own stuff as
preinstalled with no way to remove. So you can consider this as
a work (at least an attempt) for this case.

# What if I don't want an app to be replaced but still use this?

Each replacement will have a variable assigned. Set that variable
to `true` to prevent the replacement/removal.

# Variables

Variables have a really simple scheme: `KEEP_$(APPNAME)`

All variables possible are as follows;

```
KEEP_BROMITE := true
```
